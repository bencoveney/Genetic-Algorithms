# _Genetic Algorithms_
This repository includes 4 C# projects in a single solution

1. Genetic Algorithms Library (GAL)
2. Unit-Tests for GAL
3. GUI application built on GAL (DE & EN)

## Included Projects

The following projects are included in this repository:

### Genetic Algorithms

The base genetic algorithms project, including some basic example classes which can be modified for use in your own projects.

### Genetic Algorithms Test

Unit tests for the Genetic Algorithms projects.

### GeneticAlgorithmsExample_BoolString

An example implementation of the Genetic Algorithms library in which bit-strings are evolved

### GeneticAlgortihmsGUI/GUI_EN

An example implementation of the Genetic Algorithms library in which a spaceship attemts to land on the moon's surface

## Build & Run

To run the GUI application simply build the solution and run the executable artifact.

You will need to download the [ZedGraph Library](http://sourceforge.net/projects/zedgraph/?source=navbar) and ensure it is correctly reference in order to build the GeneticAlgorithmsGUI projects
