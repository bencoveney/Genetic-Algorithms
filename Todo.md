# Things To Do

A big ol' list of things to do on this project:

* ~~.Net XML commenting~~
* ~~switch from arraylists to strongly typed lists~~
* ~~remove CopyTos~~
* ensure cloning
* mutation constants and passed as params
* crossover as a probability
* run until fitness it some amount
* logging (and graphing?)
* dont discard old populations
* Crossover recombinator with random crossover point
* crossover produces two children
* refactor List<chromosome> into a population class so that totalFitness doesnt have to be passed around
* should IFitnessFunctionProvider be passed a List<Gene> or chromosome?
* specify IGene.Equals as part of IEquatable
* should duplication/dropping of genes be part of a seperate variable length chromosome implementation?
* Tests
